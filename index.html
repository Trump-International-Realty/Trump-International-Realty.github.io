            The Trump Organization is the world’s only global luxury real estate super-brand, and is responsible for many of the world’s most recognized properties. Renowned for its leadership in real estate sales, marketing, development, and management, the Trump name would like to expand its excellence, and reclaim its roots, by offering one of the most celebrated properties, The Trump Towers, as affordable housing to our communities most affected by the disastrous policies set in place by the Obama administration. With this new venture, Trump is recognizing the humanity and dignity in all people who work and live in our beautiful country carrying on the legacy of his father. This unprecedented and unparalleled opportunity will provide our valued citizens with home security enabling them to be active economic agents in the promise of perfection and prosperity in making America great again.
          </p>
