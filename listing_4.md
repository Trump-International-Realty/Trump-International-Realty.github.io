        <h3>Workers who lost their jobs</h3>


        <p>After the double-shift that you have to work in order to combat the rising cost of basic goods and services it is nice to come home to spectacular, direct Park and City views from every room. Enjoy double exposure in the living room when you find a few spare hours to relax. Despite losing your factory job when your company moved its industry to China, you now are still able to afford elegant American produced hardwood floors and floor to ceiling windows built in American glass factories. This unit comes with excellent closet space in which you can keep your American Dream alive and well.</p>
