          <h3>Muslim refugees extensive process to vet whether you are a terrorist </h3>


          <p>Introducing Midtown East's newest address for those from the Middle East! This sprawling two bedroom, two bathroom residence is perfect for Muslim refugees who have gone through an extensive vetting process and renounced their Islamic faith. Closet space abounds and a storage unit in the basement is included where you can store your copy of the Quran until you move out. The marble bathtub will make you feel like the Sultan of Syria.</p> 
          <p>Building amenities include a "sky lounge" on the 21st and 22nd floors with a 52-foot-long indoor swimming pool, sauna, double-height motion studio, as well as media and dining room with a catering kitchen. These will particularly appeal to Muslims familiar with these amenities and wishing to move from Trump Towers in Turkey, Bali or Dubai. Muslims from these areas do not need to go through a formal vetting process.</p>
