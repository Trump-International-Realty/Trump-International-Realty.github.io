        <h3>Veterans</h3>


        <p>Coming back from a war we shouldn’t have gotten into in the first place means you need a place that feels like home. You need a place that feels like you are appreciated for the sacrifice you’ve made for our country. That’s why we’re offering this three bedroom three and a half bath renovated condo that offers picture postcard views of Central Park to look over and be reminded of the great country you defended. The unit boasts three en suite baths as well as a powder room, an eat in kitchen where you don’t have to eat MREs, a washer dryer, and ample closet space. Extremely private, this is one of only two apartments on the floor so that when you feel overwhelmed by the change in pace coming back to the USA you can have space to be alone. This unit is especially good for the veteran who is suffering from PTSD and his or her family. It’s hard to be suicidal with these views! And the privacy of each bedroom means that your son won’t have to hear you when you struggle through trying to understand the role you took in an endless war.</p>
