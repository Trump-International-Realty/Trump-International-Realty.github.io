        <h3>Hardworking Hispanics</h3>


        <p>With this newly renovated kitchen you will feel like you are back home eating nachos in El Salvador! It has the feel of a downtown loft with an uptown location. While you won’t be able to hear the waves lap against the ocean sand, you can now listen to the rushing water of your marble bath and the churning of your own private washer and dryer.</p>

        <p>The hard work of the Hispanics in the country should not go unnoticed, and it will be hard to be unnoticed as you look out your window enjoying the nice eastern light in the mornings and pleasant views of Central Park. Situated across the street from the park on one of the most famous strips of real estate in the world, you are just a short stroll to some of New York City's most incredible shops, restaurants, hotels and entertainment venues where you can spend the money you’ve earned by becoming a hard working member of our great American society. Sorry, pet are not allowed.</p>
